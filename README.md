# Coronavirus tracker

## About application

Pretty simple app for tracking the number of patients with coronavirus in which I learned how to use REST API in flutter.
I took it from Udemy courses - [Flutter REST API Crash Course: Build a Coronavirus App](https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-rest-api-crash-course-build-a-coronavirus-app/)
